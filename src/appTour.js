/**
 * Guided tour steps for react-joyride.
 * Dashboard steps use [data-tour] in App.jsx and Controls.jsx.
 * From step index {@link TOUR_FIRST_COMPARE_STEP_INDEX} onward, targets live on `/compare`.
 * App.jsx adds async `step.before()` hooks that `navigate()` and wait for the target in the DOM
 * (Joyride only emits STEP_AFTER the target exists, so route changes must happen in `before`).
